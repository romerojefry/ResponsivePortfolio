# ResponsivePortfolio 

I have created a mobile website that is semantic HTML and have created three pages within my project that is mobile friendly. First page is you'll see a functional nav bar with a container that has a paragraph with an image. Second I created a contact page with input of email, password and a message box. Last page I create five links with images on them that direct you back to contact page. My project is functional for a bio website and with links directly easily to each page and if any questions or interest on the three page. Links are dirscted to the contact page. 

## Technologies Used

'''HTML 
\\ I created a functional nav bar and modified it with the back ground colors. I also used bootstrap to created with my spacing 'col-lg-3 ml-4' and a body paragraph

    <a class="navbar-brand col-lg-3 ml-4  bg-warning" href="file:///Users/jefryromero/Desktop/ResponsivePortfolio/index.html#"><h1>Jefry Romero</br></h1></a>

          <label for="exampleFormControlTextarea1">Message</label>
          <textarea class="form-control" id="exampleFormControlTextarea1" rows="3"></textarea>

\\I created a image with a link on top with sub categories and the links directing back to contact page for any question a person using the web might have. I also had to change the PX for the image to fit inside the card 
 <div class="card text-white bg-secondary mb-3 m-3" style="max-width: 18rem;">
